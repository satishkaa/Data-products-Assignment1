The objective of this app is to help car buyers identify which factors play a crucial role in determining the mileage.

We based our study based on data extracted from 1974 Motor Trend US Magazine. 

The interactive app helps the users identify the relationship between MPG (miles per gallon) and the following variables for each category ( 4 cylinders, 6 cylinders or 8 cylinders)


 - disp (Displacement)
 - wt (Weight in lb/1000)
 - hp (Gross horsepower)
 - drat (Rear axle ratio)
 - qsec (1/4 mile time)


Please select No of cylinders and the variable of interest (disp,wt,hp,drat,qsec)

We display the relationship plot between variable of interest and MPG for the specified number of cylinders.

We also display the linear regression equation of the relation and R2 of the model.

We also present the data used in analysis of the specified category for reference.
